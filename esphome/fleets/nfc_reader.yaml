# FLEET — NFC/RFID Readers
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# Logical fleet grouping for PN532-based NFC/RFID reader devices.
# Provides firmware lineage and deployment metadata only.
#
# A fleet MUST NOT:
#   - define sensors, binary_sensors, buttons, switches
#   - define hardware behavior (I2C, GPIO, PN532, etc.)
#   - create or remove ESPHome entities
#   - assume specific device wiring
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CARDINALITY RULE
# ----------------
# Each device MUST include exactly ONE fleet file.
# Fleets are mutually exclusive. Devices may include MANY capabilities.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CHANGE SAFETY
# -------------
# Changes here must be SAFE and NON-DESTRUCTIVE:
#   - updating values must not create/remove entities
#   - moving a device between fleets must not require refactoring capabilities
#
substitutions:
  # Fleet identifier used for grouping and labeling
  fleet_id: "nfc_reader"

  # Human-readable operational role
  fleet_role: "nfc_rfid_reading"

  # ESPHome project identity (lowercase, namespace/name)
  fleet_project: "gbt.nfc-readers"

  # Firmware lineage/version tracking
  fleet_firmware_version: "0.0.0"

  # Logging inherits default from universal base; override per-device if needed.
  log_level: DEBUG
