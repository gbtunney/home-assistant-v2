# ============================================================
# FLEET — ENVIRONMENTAL SENSOR NODES
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# This file defines a *fleet*:
# a logical, operational grouping of devices that share
# firmware lineage, rollout cadence, and high-level role.
#
# A fleet represents:
#   - a firmware family
#   - a deployment / rollout group
#   - a reporting / labeling boundary
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A FLEET MAY:
#   - define substitutions (metadata only)
#   - define firmware family identity
#   - define rollout / versioning information
#   - describe the operational role of devices
#
# A FLEET MUST NOT:
#   - define sensors, binary_sensors, buttons, switches
#   - define hardware behavior (BLE, Dallas, GPIO, etc.)
#   - create or remove ESPHome entities
#   - assume specific device wiring
#
# If it affects runtime behavior, it does NOT belong here.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CARDINALITY RULE
# ---------------
# Each device MUST include exactly ONE fleet file.
# Fleets are mutually exclusive.
#
# Devices may include MANY capabilities.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CHANGE SAFETY
# -------------
# Changes to this file should be SAFE and NON-DESTRUCTIVE:
#   - updating values here must not create/remove entities
#   - moving a device between fleets must not require
#     refactoring device or capability logic
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------

substitutions:
  # Fleet identifier
  # Used for:
  #   - ESPHome project.name
  #   - firmware family identification
  #   - Home Assistant labeling / grouping
  fleet_id: "env_sensors"

  # High-level operational role (human-readable)
  # Informational only — no logic should depend on this
  fleet_role: "environmental_temperature_monitoring"

  # Firmware version for this fleet
  # Used for diagnostics and future update policy
  fleet_firmware_version: "0.0.0"
