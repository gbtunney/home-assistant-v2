# FLEET — SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# This fleet defines devices whose *primary role* is to act as
# Bluetooth Proxy infrastructure for Home Assistant.
#
# These devices:
#   - relay BLE traffic to Home Assistant
#   - support nearby BLE-based integrations (e.g. Bermuda)
#   - provide shared RF infrastructure
#
# They do NOT:
#   - own sensors or actuators
#   - represent physical measurements
#   - implement device-specific logic
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# FLEET CONTRACT
# --------------
# A fleet represents:
#   - firmware lineage
#   - rollout cadence
#   - operational role
#
# A fleet MUST NOT:
#   - define sensors, binary_sensors, buttons, switches
#   - define hardware behavior (BLE, GPIO, buses)
#   - create or remove ESPHome entities
#   - assume wiring or peripherals
#
# Hardware behavior is defined exclusively by capabilities.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CARDINALITY RULE
# ---------------
# Each device MUST include exactly ONE fleet file.
# Fleets are mutually exclusive.
#
# Devices may include MANY capabilities.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CHANGE SAFETY
# -------------
# Changes to this file must be SAFE and NON-DESTRUCTIVE:
#   - updating values here must not create/remove entities
#   - moving a device between fleets must not require
#     refactoring device or capability logic
#
substitutions:
  # Fleet identifier
  # Used for:
  #   - ESPHome project.name
  #   - firmware family identification
  #   - Home Assistant labeling / grouping
  fleet_id: "capacitive_moisture_sensors"

  # High-level operational role (human-readable)
  # Informational only — no logic should depend on this
  fleet_role: "soil_moisture_monitoring"

  # ESPHome project name (MUST be lowercase, namespace/name, no underscores)
  fleet_project: "gbt.capacitive_moisture_sensors"
  # Firmware version for this fleet
  # Used for diagnostics and future update policy
  fleet_firmware_version: "0.0.0"

  # Logging inherits default INFO from universal base.
  # For troubleshooting, temporarily override per-device to DEBUG,
  # then revert to INFO after onboarding.
